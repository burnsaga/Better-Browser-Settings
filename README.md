# Better Browser Settings

This is a guide for the average user on how to setup a web browser with better privacy settings.

## Setup

- [ ] Install [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) then go to Menu > Options and change these settings:
  - [ ] Search > change `Default Search Engine` to `DuckDuckGo`
  - [ ] Privacy & Security > set `Enhanced Tracking Protection` to `Strict` - Note: if websites aren't working as expected, set it to `Standard`
  - [ ] Privacy & Security > set `Send websites a "Do Not Track" signal...` to `Always`
  - [ ] Privacy & Security > disable all checkboxes under `Firefox Data Collection and Use`

- [ ] Install [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) - for ad and tracker blocking

- [ ] [OPTIONAL] Install a trusted password manager e.g. [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/)

## Advanced

* Use a trusted VPN e.g. [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) - to spoof your IP address/location

* Instead of Firefox, use [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) - Note: not recommended for the average user
